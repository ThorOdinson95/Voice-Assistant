# Voice Assistant with Raspberry Pi and Gemini AI
This project demonstrates the implementation of a voice assistant using a Raspberry Pi, powered by Gemini AI for natural language processing and generation. The voice assistant accepts voice input through a USB microphone, processes the input using the Gemini AI API, and provides responses via speakers. 

# Features:

Voice Input: Real-time voice recognition using a USB microphone. 

Speech Recognition: Converts voice input to text for processing.

Speech-to-Text: Accurate transcription of spoken words.

AI-Powered Responses: Intelligent responses generated through Gemini AI API.

Audio Output: High-quality audio responses via speakers.

Raspberry Pi Integration: Optimized for Raspberry Pi hardware.
